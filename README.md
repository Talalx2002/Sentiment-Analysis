# IMDb Sentiment Analysis with TensorFlow

This project implements a sentiment analysis model using TensorFlow and TensorFlow Hub. The model is trained on the IMDb dataset to predict whether a movie review is positive or negative.

## Overview
The code consists of two main parts:
1. **Training the Model:** The model architecture includes a pre-trained word embedding layer from TensorFlow Hub followed by a fully connected neural network. The model is trained on the IMDb dataset, which is split into training, validation, and test sets.

2. **Predicting Sentiment:** After training, the model is saved and can be used to predict sentiment on new movie reviews. Users can input their own movie reviews, and the model will predict whether the review is positive or negative.
